# ML-Based Image Classification Backend API

## Overview
This project implements a scalable backend API for real-time image classification using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system exposes RESTful endpoints using FastAPI and is containerized with Docker for production-ready deployment on a cloud platform.

## Problem Statement
Deploying machine learning models into real-world applications requires a reliable backend that can handle image inputs, perform efficient inference, and return predictions with low latency while maintaining clean and maintainable code.

## Solution
A FastAPI-based backend service was developed to integrate a trained CNN model for image classification. The application follows a modular, object-oriented architecture and is containerized using Docker to ensure portability and scalability in cloud environments.
